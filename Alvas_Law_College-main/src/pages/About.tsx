          Dr. M Mohan Alva set up an Ayurvedic clinic in Moodubidire in 1980 to cater to the basic health needs of the people of his village, primarily addressing issues like snake bites. In 1982, he established Alva‚Äôs Pharmacy to produce essential medicines. Responding to evolving needs, the clinic was upgraded into a full-fledged multi-specialty hospital‚ÄîAlva‚Äôs Health Center‚Äîin 1986. After addressing local healthcare needs, Dr. Alva focused on societal upliftment by creating job opportunities for rural youth through paramedical courses. This led to the birth of Alva‚Äôs Education Foundation (AEF) in 1995, beginning with institutes for Nursing and Physiotherapy, and followed by Nursing and Ayurvedic Medical Colleges in 1996. In 1998, he established Alva‚Äôs P.U. and Degree Colleges to introduce innovative changes in education, integrating national-level exam coaching with NCERT curriculum and fostering the Ekalavya Sports Club. Recognizing the importance of holistic development, Dr. Alva emphasized a 24-hour campus life through hostel systems and coaching for competitive exams such as CET, NEET, JEE, NDA, CLAT, IAS, and more. Alva‚Äôs pioneered educational strategies including bridge courses, crash courses, vacation coaching, and NEET long-term training, yielding exceptional student outcomes‚Äîover 300 students qualify for medical education annually.

          In 2024, Alva‚Äôs system was further refined by organizing students into 12 Blocks across Science, Commerce, Arts, and NEET divisions to ensure individual attention. Alva‚Äôs Degree College promotes ‚ÄúDegree with Purpose,‚Äù offering vocational training, civil services coaching, business skills, and higher education pathways. It consistently ranks among the top, securing 30‚Äì40 ranks under Mangalore University each year. The Foundation is acclaimed for producing postgraduates under Mangalore University, engineers under VTU, and healthcare professionals under RGUHS. The aesthetically enriched campus‚Äîwith sculptures, art, gardens, and cultural events‚Äînurtures students‚Äô creative and literary talents. Through initiatives like the Dheemkita Yakshagana Study Center, which teaches Thenku Thittu and Badagu Thittu Yakshagana and provides certification, students develop cultural awareness and artistic skills while building strong, healthy minds and bright futures.
